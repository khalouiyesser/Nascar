    <string name="news2">NTruex, togetherness and Talladega: Sunday’s playoff race may hinge on team effort</string>
    <string name="news3">Texas rattles Cup Series playoff picture once again</string>
    <string name="newsDesc1">The NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs Round of 12 continues at Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday for the YellaWood 500 (2 p.m. ET, NBC, MRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio, NBC Sports App).</string>
